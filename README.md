# Primary Simulator

A simulation tool designed to model a fictional U.S. presidential primary campaign, with a focus on Congressional District-level delegate math and narrative plausibility. This project is part of the worldbuidling process for a speculative fiction series, allowing for dynamic candidate support, delegate allocation, and campaign events.

## Goals

- Simulate Democratic primary elections at the Congressional District level
- Accurately allocate delegates using DNC rules (15% viability threshold, proportional allocation)
- Track candidate support, momentum, and delegate totals
- Support narrative development and in-world content creation

## Current Status

> ðŸ§± Project structure scaffolding complete  
> ðŸš§ MVP development in progress â€” currently building `Candidate` and `CongressionalDistrict` classes

## Project Structure

- `simulator/`: Core logic modules (candidates, districts, allocation engine)
- `data/`: Sample input data (district definitions, voter demographics)
- `scripts/`: CLI or runner scripts
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `.gitignore`: Keeps virtualenvs, logs, cache, and IDE files out of Git

## Planned Features

- Momentum shifts via events (debates, scandals, endorsements)
- Campaign finance modeling and fundraising feedback loops
- Polling and weekly state-by-state simulation
- Exportable in-world content (e.g. campaign memos, media analysis)
